# Introduction

Hurdle Poisson Regression is a **two-part statistical model** used for count data with **excess zeros** and **overdispersion**.

### **Motivation**
- Traditional **Poisson regression** assumes that the **mean equals variance**, which is often not true.
- Many datasets contain **a large proportion of zeros**, requiring a **separate modeling approach**.
- **Examples:**
  - **Doctor visits:** Some people never visit a doctor, while others visit frequently.
  - **Insurance claims:** Many policyholders never file a claim, while others do multiple times.
  - **Patent filings:** Some companies file zero patents, others file multiple.

# Methods

The **Hurdle Poisson Model** has **two components**:

### 1️⃣ **Zero vs. Non-Zero (Binary Model)**
- Uses **logistic regression** to predict whether \( Y = 0 \) or \( Y > 0 \):
$$
\log \left( \frac{P(Y = 0)}{P(Y > 0)} \right) = X \beta_0
$$

### 2️⃣ **Positive Counts (Truncated Poisson Model)**
- Once \( Y > 0 \), we model **only positive counts** using Poisson regression:
$$
P(Y = y | Y > 0) = \frac{\lambda^y e^{-\lambda}}{y!}, \quad y > 0
$$
- Mean parameter modeled as:
$$
\log(\lambda) = X \beta
$$

# Example Dataset

We use the **DoctorVisits** dataset from the `AER` package:

```{r}
# Load dataset
data("DoctorVisits", package = "AER")
str(DoctorVisits)
```

**Key Variables:**
- `visits` → Number of doctor visits.
- `illness` → Number of illnesses in past year.
- `age`, `income` → Demographic variables.

---

# Data Visualization

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
ggplot(DoctorVisits, aes(x = visits)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Doctor Visits", x = "Number of Visits", y = "Frequency")
```

**Observation:** Many zeros in the data, making it a **good candidate** for the Hurdle model.

---

# Application of Methods in R

### **Fitting a Hurdle Poisson Model**
```{r}
# Fit Hurdle Poisson Model
hurdle_model <- hurdle(visits ~ illness + age + income, data = DoctorVisits, dist = "poisson")
summary(hurdle_model)
```

### **Key Outputs:**
- **Zero-Hurdle Component** (Logistic regression)
- **Positive Counts Component** (Truncated Poisson model)

---

# Results: Model Predictions vs. Actual Data

```{r}
DoctorVisits$fitted <- predict(hurdle_model, type = "response")

ggplot(DoctorVisits, aes(x = fitted, y = visits)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Fitted vs. Actual Counts", x = "Fitted Values", y = "Actual Visits")
```

# Comparison with Other Models

| Model | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Poisson Regression** | Simple, interpretable | Can't handle excess zeros |
| **Negative Binomial** | Handles overdispersion | Still assumes one process for counts |
| **Hurdle Poisson** | Models zeros separately, more flexible | More complex |

---

# Assumptions & Considerations

*Overdispersion** – Variance > Mean.  
**Independent Observations** – Each count is independent.  
**Zero-Inflation Process** – Zeros come from a separate mechanism.  

**Not Ideal When:**  
- Zeros do **not** come from a distinct process.
- Simple Poisson regression fits well.

---

# Conclusion

 **Hurdle Poisson Regression** is ideal for count data with **excess zeros**.  
It **separates zero outcomes** from **positive counts** for better modeling.  
Useful in **healthcare, insurance, economics**, and more.  

🚀 **Try it in R using `pscl::hurdle()`!**

```{r}
# Recap: Fitting a Hurdle Poisson Model
hurdle_model <- hurdle(visits ~ illness + age + income, data = DoctorVisits, dist = "poisson")
```
